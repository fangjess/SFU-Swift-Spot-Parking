## Inspiration
We're sure that all students that commute to school by car have experienced the struggle of finding a parking spot, such as driving circles through the West Mall Parkade trying to park before your class starts. We were inspired to create the SFU Swift Spot Parking app to make finding a spot and getting the status of parking lots easier. Instead of having to go to each parking lot to see how full they are, we wanted to create an application where you'd be able to get an overview of how populate each lot is so you can plan where to park ahead of time.

## What does it do?
Swift Spot is a web application that driving students use to log where they park. Our application will keep track of how many students 'check in' at each parking lot to get an idea of how full they are. The 'fullness' status will be updated as drivers check in/out of each lot, and will be available for users to see so they can plan ahead for their commute to SFU.

## Challenges we ran into:
Our team had very little prior experience developing web applications. We ran into many challenges creating Swift Spot, most notably learning how to work with Svelte and using Firebase. Because of our limited experience working with JavaScript, HTML and CSS, designing our application involved lots of on-the-spot learning and adapting to unforseen obstacles. Several changes andd revisions were made before reaching our final product and proper communication/collaboration was crucial in order to be able to move forward and improve our project.

## What we learned:
 - Svelte
 - Firebase
 - JavaScript
 - HTML
 - CSS
 - Git

## What we're proud of:
Because this was our team's first ever project of this nature, we are very proud of our application as a whole. Some of the things we did that we think are noteworthy was learning the components of web dev on the spot and managing to create a functioning product!

## What's next?
Our team has many ideas of where we can take Swift Spot in the future. Some of our ideas we're excited about are:
- Partnering with a web designer to improve our UI
- Creating a mobile app for Swift Spot
- Adding updates for parking lots, e.g. convocation, construction, etc.
- Ability to purchase permits via Swift Spot & keeping track of what permits are being used to park by each user.

We hope that you see the potential in SFU Swift Spot, we're so excited to continue to grow our project and create something everybody can find useful!
